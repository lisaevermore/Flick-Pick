## Description:
This is an application which presents a random selection of films based off of your chosen genre. Once a genre is selected, it will display random films from that genre in a grid of movie posters. When a poster is selected, the trailer for that film will play in order to give you a preview of what you want to watch. You also have the capability to search for a specific film which will then be displayed in a table of results. When the title of the film is selected, a trailer for that video will play.

This application was aimed for a target audience of people that are struggling to find a new film to watch. This webpage helps to randomise films based off of a chosen genre or a search of a specific word/movie title.
